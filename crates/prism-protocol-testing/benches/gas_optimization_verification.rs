/// Should test:
/// - Measure CU consumption for each instruction type
/// - Verify claim_tokens_v0 CU usage is reasonable (most critical)
/// - Compare CU usage between different instruction paths
/// - Test CU usage with different data sizes (large merkle proofs, etc.)
/// - Verify no regression in CU consumption after optimizations
/// - Document baseline CU costs for performance monitoring
/// - Test instruction combinations and cumulative CU costs
/// - Identify most expensive operations for optimization priorities

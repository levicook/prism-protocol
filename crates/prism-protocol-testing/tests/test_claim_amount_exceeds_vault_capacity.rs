/// Test claim with extremely large amounts → Large number arithmetic edge cases
///
/// **HIGH BUG POTENTIAL**: This test targets large number arithmetic that could expose 
/// precision loss, overflow, or capacity validation bugs.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Extremely large entitlements * amount_per_entitlement (near u64::MAX)
/// - Vault capacity vs calculated claim amounts
/// - Precision loss in large number arithmetic
/// - Real-world large number handling edge cases
///
/// **Why this is critical:**
/// Large number arithmetic can expose subtle bugs:
/// ```rust
/// let total_amount = cohort
///     .amount_per_entitlement  // ← Very large number
///     .checked_mul(entitlements)  // ← Could approach u64::MAX
///     .ok_or(ErrorCode::NumericOverflow)?;
/// ```
///
/// **Potential bugs:**
/// - Calculation succeeds but exceeds any reasonable vault capacity
/// - Precision loss in intermediate calculations
/// - Large number serialization/deserialization issues
/// - Real-world scenarios with high-value tokens (BTC, ETH equivalents)
/// - Overflow in related calculations (percentages, fees, etc.)
///
/// **Test Strategy:**
/// 1. Create campaign with very large amount_per_entitlement
/// 2. Set up claimant with large entitlements
/// 3. Ensure calculation doesn't overflow but creates unrealistic claim
/// 4. Verify proper handling when claim exceeds vault capacity
/// 5. Test with realistic high-value token scenarios
///
/// **Expected behavior:** Either proper validation or graceful large number handling

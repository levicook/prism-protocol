/// Should test:
/// - Multiple cohorts with different merkle roots in same campaign
/// - Multiple vaults per cohort with different funding levels  
/// - Fingerprint consistency across all operations
/// - Campaign with maximum number of cohorts and vaults
/// - Mint mismatch across different instruction combinations
/// - PDA seed collision scenarios (if possible)
/// - Complex claim scenarios with multiple users and vaults
/// - Stress test: campaign → multiple cohorts → multiple vaults → many claims

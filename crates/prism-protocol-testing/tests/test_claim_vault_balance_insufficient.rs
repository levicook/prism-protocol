/// Test claim when vault balance < claim amount → SPL Token transfer failure
///
/// **HIGH BUG POTENTIAL**: This test targets the interaction between our calculation logic
/// and SPL Token's transfer validation, which could expose arithmetic or validation bugs.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Token transfer when vault balance is insufficient for claim
/// - Exact boundary conditions (vault balance = claim amount - 1)
/// - SPL Token program error handling vs our validation
/// - State consistency when token transfer fails
///
/// **Why this is critical:**
/// Our claim logic calculates: `total_amount = amount_per_entitlement * entitlements`
/// Then calls: `token::transfer(vault -> claimant, total_amount)`
/// 
/// The SPL Token program has its own validation that vault balance >= transfer amount.
/// Potential bugs:
/// - Our calculation succeeds but SPL transfer fails
/// - Race condition: vault balance changes between calculation and transfer
/// - Precision issues in large number arithmetic
/// - Edge case: vault balance = 0 exactly
/// - Edge case: vault balance = claim amount - 1 (boundary)
///
/// **Test Strategy:**
/// 1. Set up valid claim with calculated claim amount
/// 2. Drain vault to below claim amount (test various levels)
/// 3. Attempt claim → should fail with SPL Token error
/// 4. Verify proper error propagation (not silent failure)
/// 5. Verify no ClaimReceipt created
/// 6. Verify claimant balance unchanged
///
/// **Expected behavior:** SPL Token transfer failure, proper error propagation, no state corruption

/// Test claim with maximum merkle proof size → Resource limit validation
///
/// **MEDIUM BUG POTENTIAL**: This test targets resource consumption boundaries that could
/// expose compute/memory limits, DoS vectors, or serialization bugs.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Very large merkle proofs (near compute/memory limits)
/// - Instruction data size limits and serialization
/// - Compute budget exhaustion during proof verification
/// - Memory allocation for large Vec<[u8; 32]> proofs
///
/// **Why this is critical:**
/// Merkle proof verification involves recursive hashing:
/// ```rust
/// fn verify_merkle_proof(proof: &[[u8; 32]], root: &[u8; 32], leaf: &[u8; 32]) -> bool {
///     let mut computed_hash = *leaf;
///     for p_elem in proof.iter() {  // ← What if proof has 1000+ elements?
/// ```
///
/// **Potential bugs:**
/// - Stack overflow with very deep proofs
/// - Compute budget exhaustion (> 200k CU limit)
/// - Transaction size limits exceeded
/// - Memory allocation failures for large proofs
/// - DoS attack vector via intentionally large proofs

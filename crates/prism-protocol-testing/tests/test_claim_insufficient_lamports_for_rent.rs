/// Test claim when claimant has insufficient lamports for ATA rent → Account creation failure
///
/// **HIGH BUG POTENTIAL**: This test targets `init_if_needed` edge cases that could expose
/// subtle bugs in account initialization logic and rent calculation.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Account initialization when claimant has insufficient SOL for rent exemption
/// - Proper error handling vs partial transaction success  
/// - State consistency when account creation fails mid-transaction
/// - Rent calculation edge cases for Associated Token Accounts
///
/// **Why this is critical:**
/// The `init_if_needed` constraint in claim_tokens_v0 creates an ATA for the claimant if it
/// doesn't exist. This involves:
/// 1. Rent calculation for new account
/// 2. SOL deduction from claimant 
/// 3. Account creation with proper ownership
/// 
/// Edge cases that could expose bugs:
/// - Claimant has EXACTLY enough SOL for tx fees but not rent
/// - Claimant has partial SOL (enough for fees, not enough for rent)
/// - Race conditions where multiple claims try to init same ATA
/// - Rent exemption threshold changes during transaction
///
/// **Test Strategy:**
/// 1. Set up valid claim scenario
/// 2. Drain claimant SOL to precise levels (just tx fees, partial rent, etc.)
/// 3. Attempt claim → should fail gracefully with proper error
/// 4. Verify no partial state corruption (no partial account creation)
/// 5. Verify vault balances unchanged
///
/// **Expected behavior:** Clean failure with account creation error, no state corruption

    // 3. Drain claimant SOL to below rent threshold

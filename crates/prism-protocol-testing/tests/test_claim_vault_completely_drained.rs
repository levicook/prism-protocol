/// Test claim when vault balance = 0 exactly → Zero balance edge case handling
///
/// **HIGH BUG POTENTIAL**: This test targets zero-balance arithmetic and edge case handling
/// that could expose division-by-zero or unexpected success/failure modes.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Token transfer when vault is completely empty (balance = 0)
/// - Zero arithmetic edge cases in calculation logic
/// - SPL Token behavior with zero-amount transfers
/// - Error handling vs unexpected success for impossible scenarios
///
/// **Why this is critical:**
/// Empty vaults represent a critical edge case where multiple issues could arise:
/// 1. **Arithmetic edge cases**: 0 balance vs calculated claim amount
/// 2. **SPL Token behavior**: Does transfer(0) succeed or fail?
/// 3. **State corruption**: ClaimReceipt creation with zero transfer
/// 4. **Logic bugs**: Should this be prevented earlier or handled gracefully?
///
/// **Specific scenarios to test:**
/// - Vault starts with tokens, gets completely drained by other claims
/// - Original vault setup with 0 balance (configuration error)
/// - Race condition: vault drained between validation and transfer
/// - Multiple claims against same empty vault
///
/// **Key questions this test answers:**
/// - Does SPL Token allow transfer(from_vault, to_claimant, 0)?
/// - Do we create ClaimReceipt for zero-token claims?
/// - Is this a configuration error or runtime error?
/// - Does this corrupt any counters or state?
///
/// **Test Strategy:**
/// 1. Set up valid claim scenario
/// 2. Completely drain vault (set balance to exactly 0)
/// 3. Attempt claim → observe behavior (fail vs succeed)
/// 4. If succeeds: verify no tokens transferred, ClaimReceipt handling
/// 5. If fails: verify proper error and no state corruption
///
/// **Expected behavior:** TBD - this test will help determine correct behavior

/// Test claim with PDA security validation → Understanding Anchor's PDA architecture
///
/// **EDUCATIONAL VALUE**: This test explores PDA security assumptions and validates
/// how Anchor's PDA validation actually works in practice.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Instruction-level bump manipulation (doesn't affect security - as expected!)
/// - Real PDA validation through account derivation and signatures
/// - Duplicate claim prevention through claim receipt validation
/// - Multiple legitimate claimants with unique PDA addresses
///
/// **Key Discovery:**
/// PDA security in Anchor works at the **account/address level**, not instruction data level:
/// ```rust
/// // Security happens here - when Anchor validates account addresses match expected derivation
/// #[account(
///     seeds = [COHORT_V0_SEED_PREFIX, campaign.key().as_ref(), &cohort_merkle_root],
///     bump = cohort.bump
/// )]
/// pub cohort: Account<'info, CohortV0>,
/// ```
///
/// **How PDA Security Actually Works:**
/// - Account addresses are cryptographically derived from seeds + program ID
/// - Each claimant gets unique PDA addresses based on their public key
/// - Anchor validates provided addresses match expected derivation
/// - Instruction data manipulation doesn't bypass account-level validation
/// - Signature verification ensures only legitimate claimants can authorize transactions
///
/// **Attack scenarios this prevents:**
/// - Cross-claimant impersonation (different claimants have different PDAs)
/// - Double-claiming (claim receipts track completed claims)
/// - Account authority confusion (each PDA is tied to specific claimant)
/// - Replay attacks (transaction signatures are unique per claimant)
///
/// **Test Strategy:**
/// 1. Set up valid claim scenario with multiple claimants
/// 2. Test instruction-level bump manipulation (should succeed - proves data independence)
/// 3. Test legitimate different claimant (should succeed - proves PDA uniqueness)
/// 4. Test duplicate claiming (should fail - proves claim receipt validation)
/// 5. Validate that security works through account derivation, not instruction data
///
/// **Expected behavior:**
/// - Instruction data manipulation succeeds (proving security is at account level)
/// - Legitimate claimants succeed (proving PDA derivation works correctly)
/// - Duplicate claims fail (proving claim receipt validation works)
/// - Overall: Demonstrates robust security through proper account architecture

    // 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS FOR DEVELOPERS:
    //
    // 1. **PDA VALIDATION ARCHITECTURE**: In Anchor, PDA validation happens at the account
    //    constraint level, not through instruction data manipulation. The framework
    //    validates that the provided PDA addresses match the expected derivation.
    //    This is a SOPHISTICATED and SECURE design.
    //
    // 2. **INSTRUCTION DATA INDEPENDENCE**: Manipulating bump values in instruction data
    //    doesn't affect security because the actual PDA addresses in the accounts
    //    array are what get validated against the canonical derivation. This separation
    //    of concerns is a security feature, not a bug.
    //
    // 3. **ACCOUNT-LEVEL SECURITY**: Each claimant has unique PDA addresses derived from
    //    their public key. You can't use one claimant's signature to authorize
    //    transactions for another claimant's accounts. This prevents cross-claimant
    //    impersonation at the cryptographic level.
    //
    // 4. **SIGNATURE VERIFICATION**: The most important security layer is signature
    //    verification - ensuring only the legitimate claimant can sign transactions
    //    that use their derived PDA addresses. Combined with unique PDA derivation,
    //    this creates an unforgeable security model.
    //
    // 5. **CLAIM RECEIPT VALIDATION**: The protocol prevents double-claiming through
    //    claim receipts that are created on first claim and checked on subsequent
    //    attempts. This adds a state-based security layer on top of cryptographic
    //    validation.
    //
    // 6. **DEFENSE IN DEPTH**: Multiple validation layers work together:
    //    - PDA derivation (unique addresses per claimant)
    //    - Account constraint validation (Anchor verifies address derivation)
    //    - Signature verification (only legitimate claimant can sign)
    //    - State validation (claim receipts prevent double-claiming)
    //    - Merkle proof verification (proves claimant is in allowlist)
    //
    // 7. **REAL-WORLD SECURITY**: This test validates that the security model works
    //    as designed. Attackers cannot bypass security through instruction manipulation
    //    because the real security boundaries are at the account and cryptographic
    //    levels, which are much harder to circumvent.
    //
    // 8. **ANCHOR FRAMEWORK BENEFITS**: This demonstrates why Anchor's account constraint
    //    system is so powerful - it moves security validation from manual checks in
    //    instruction handlers to declarative constraints that are harder to get wrong
    //    and more robust against attack.

/// Helper function to create an instruction with modified bump values in the helper parameters

/// This demonstrates that manipulating bump values at the instruction data level doesn't
/// affect security, because Anchor validates PDA addresses at the account constraint level.
///
/// **Educational Purpose**: Shows that the real security boundary is account derivation,
/// not instruction data manipulation. This is the CORRECT behavior - instruction data
/// should be independent of account validation security.
///
/// **What this simulates**: An attacker trying to manipulate instruction parameters,
/// which doesn't work because the account addresses themselves are what get validated.

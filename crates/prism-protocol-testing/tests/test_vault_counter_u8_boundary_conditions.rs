/// Test vault counter arithmetic at u8 boundary conditions
///
/// **BACKGROUND**: This test validates that vault counter arithmetic works correctly at
/// u8 boundary conditions, especially with consistent hashing collisions that create
/// zero-entitlement vaults.
///
/// **CRITICAL BUG PREVENTED**: Previously, zero-entitlement vaults (caused by consistent
/// hashing collisions) would fail compilation with "Vault with zero entitlements should
/// not be created". This test ensures our fix allows empty vaults gracefully.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Normal vault counter increments work correctly (0 ‚Üí 10 vaults)
/// - Maximum capacity counter arithmetic (0 ‚Üí 255 vaults, u8::MAX boundary)
/// - Complete vault lifecycle with zero-entitlement vaults from hash collisions
/// - Smart contract counter validation: `checked_add(1).ok_or(ErrorCode::NumericOverflow)`
///
/// **Why u8::MAX (255) matters:**
/// Vault indices are u8, so testing 255 vaults exercises the maximum possible vault count
/// and stresses the counter increment logic used throughout the vault lifecycle.
///
/// **Hash collision insight:**
/// With 255 vaults and 1 claimant each, consistent hashing often creates collisions,
/// leaving some vaults empty (0 entitlements). This test proves our system handles
/// these edge cases gracefully rather than failing compilation.

/// Test claim with maximum instruction data size → Instruction size limit validation
///
/// **MEDIUM BUG POTENTIAL**: This test targets serialization and network layer boundaries
/// that could expose size limits, DoS vectors, or data corruption bugs.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Maximum-sized instruction data near Solana limits
/// - Serialization/deserialization with large data
/// - Network layer instruction size validation
/// - Transaction size limits and proper error handling
///
/// **Why this is critical:**
/// Solana has strict limits on instruction and transaction sizes:
/// - Transaction limit: ~1232 bytes
/// - Instruction data varies by available space
/// - Large merkle proofs + other data could exceed limits
///
/// **Potential bugs:**
/// - Instruction data exceeds size limits silently
/// - Serialization fails with large data but error not handled
/// - Network rejection vs program-level validation
/// - Data corruption during large data serialization
/// - DoS attack vector via intentionally large instructions
///
/// **Test Strategy:**
/// 1. Create claim instruction with maximum possible data size
/// 2. Use large merkle proof + large fingerprint + other large fields
/// 3. Test serialization at size boundaries
/// 4. Attempt to send instruction → observe size limit handling
/// 5. Verify proper error handling vs silent failures
/// 6. Test both "just under limit" and "over limit" scenarios
///
/// **Size Components to Test:**
/// - Large merkle proofs (primary size contributor)
/// - Campaign fingerprint (32 bytes)
/// - Cohort merkle root (32 bytes)
/// - Other instruction parameters
/// - Account metadata overhead
///
/// **Expected behavior:** Proper size validation or graceful handling of size limits

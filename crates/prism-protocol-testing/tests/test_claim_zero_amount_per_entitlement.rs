/// Test claim with amount_per_entitlement = 0 → Zero arithmetic edge cases
///
/// **HIGH BUG POTENTIAL**: This test targets zero arithmetic that could expose
/// division-by-zero, unexpected behavior, or configuration validation bugs.
///
/// **What this tests:**
/// - Campaign configuration with amount_per_entitlement = 0 exactly
/// - Arithmetic: 0 * entitlements = 0 calculation handling
/// - Token transfer with amount = 0
/// - ClaimReceipt creation for zero-value claims
/// - Business logic: Is this valid configuration or error?
///
/// **Why this is critical:**
/// Zero arithmetic often exposes edge cases that developers don't anticipate:
/// ```rust
/// let total_amount = cohort
///     .amount_per_entitlement  // ← What if this is 0?
///     .checked_mul(entitlements)
///     .ok_or(ErrorCode::NumericOverflow)?;
/// ```
///
/// **Potential bugs:**
/// - Configuration allows amount_per_entitlement = 0 but breaks runtime
/// - Division by zero in related calculations (percentages, etc.)
/// - SPL Token transfer(0) has unexpected behavior
/// - ClaimReceipt creation with claimed_amount = 0 corrupts accounting
/// - Business logic assumes non-zero amounts in other operations
///
/// **Key questions this test answers:**
/// - Should campaigns allow amount_per_entitlement = 0?
/// - Does 0 * entitlements = 0 work correctly?
/// - Do we create ClaimReceipt for zero-value claims?
/// - Does this break any accounting or aggregation logic?
/// - Is this a configuration error or valid edge case?
///
/// **Test Strategy:**
/// 1. Create campaign with amount_per_entitlement = 0 exactly
/// 2. Set up valid claimant with normal entitlements
/// 3. Attempt claim → observe behavior
/// 4. If succeeds: verify 0 tokens transferred, proper ClaimReceipt
/// 5. If fails: verify proper validation error at campaign level
/// 6. Test related operations (vault funding, etc.) with zero amounts
///
/// **Expected behavior:** Either proper validation error or graceful zero handling

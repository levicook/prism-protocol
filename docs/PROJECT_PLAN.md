## 3. Key Design Decisions & Implementation Notes

*   **âœ… Campaign Fingerprint System:**
    *   Campaigns are identified by a cryptographic fingerprint derived from constituent cohort merkle roots
    *   Ensures immutability and verifiability of campaign definitions
*   **âœ… Merkle Tree Security:**
    *   Domain separation using 0x00 prefix for leaves, 0x01 for internal nodes
    *   Prevents second preimage attacks and ensures proof integrity
*   **âœ… Vault Assignment:**
    *   Consistent hashing distributes claimants across multiple vaults
    *   Reduces write contention while maintaining deterministic assignment
*   **âœ… Modular Architecture:**
    *   Clean separation between on-chain program and off-chain utilities
    *   Reusable SDK and testing components

## 4. Benchmarking Plan (using Mollusk SVM)

*   **Objective:** Quantitatively validate performance, scalability, and resource consumption.
*   **On-Chain Benchmarking Areas:**
    *   [ ] **`claim_tokens_v0` Performance:**
        *   CU consumption vs. proof length for various cohort sizes
        *   Transaction size analysis
        *   Maximum practical cohort size determination
    *   [ ] **Account Sizes & Rent:**
        *   Document rent costs for `CampaignV0`, `CohortV0`, `ClaimReceiptV0` PDAs
        *   Compare costs across different vault configurations
    *   [ ] **Initialization Instructions:**
        *   CU consumption for each instruction type
        *   Transaction size analysis
*   **Off-Chain Benchmarking Areas:**
    *   [ ] Merkle tree generation time for large claimant lists
    *   [ ] Proof generation time and memory usage
    *   [ ] Consistent hashing performance

## 5. Documentation Checklist

*   [x] `PROJECT_PLAN.md`: Updated to reflect current implementation âœ…
*   [ ] `DESIGN_NOTES.md`: Update to match actual implementation
*   [ ] `CAMPAIGN_SETUP_GUIDE.md`: Update for future CLI implementation
*   [ ] `README.md`: Update with new crate structure information
*   [ ] **API Documentation:** Document the SDK crate public interfaces

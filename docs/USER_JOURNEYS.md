# Prism Protocol User Journeys & Trust Model

## üéØ Overview

This document maps out user journeys and trust relationships to identify verification mechanisms needed for both hosted and self-hosted scenarios.

**Core Trust Challenge**: How do users verify that data serving (hosted or self-hosted) hasn't been tampered with?

## üéØ Simplified User Journeys (IPFS-First)

### **Campaign Creator: "Publish Unforgeable Data"**

```
1. CSV ‚Üí CLI validate ‚Üí CLI publish to IPFS ‚Üí Get immutable hash
2. Choose: hosted service OR self-host
3. Site generation happens from unforgeable IPFS inputs
4. Auditors can verify site matches original IPFS content
```

### **Token Claimant: "Fast Static Site Experience"**

```
1. Visit normal URL: https://my-airdrop.prism.com
2. Fast static site loads (not ipfs.io URLs)
3. Site loads campaign data from IPFS hash (verified)
4. Connect wallet and claim (normal UX)
```

### **Auditor: "Verify Published Site Against IPFS"**

```bash
# Download what the site is serving
wget https://my-airdrop.prism.com/campaign-data.json

# Verify it matches the claimed IPFS content
prism-protocol-cli verify-site-integrity \
  --site-data campaign-data.json \
  --claimed-ipfs QmCampaignABC123...

# If verification passes ‚Üí site is serving authentic data
# If verification fails ‚Üí tampering detected
```

## üåü Value Propositions by User Type

### **For Campaign Creators**

- **Unforgeable inputs** - IPFS content addressing prevents tampering
- **Choice of hosting** - Use our hosted service OR self-host

- Needs to ensure only intended recipients can claim
- Must trust that service provider hasn't injected additional claimants

### **Token Claimant**

- Wants to discover eligible campaigns
- Needs to verify eligibility amounts are correct
- Must trust that displayed entitlements match on-chain reality

### **Frontend Builder**

- Wants to build claimant interfaces
- Needs reliable access to campaign/claimant data
- Must choose between hosted service vs self-hosting

### **Auditor/Verifier**

- Wants to verify campaign integrity
- Needs to validate that deployed campaigns match original intent
- Must be able to reconstruct and verify merkle trees independently

## üîç Campaign Creator Journey: Trust but Verify

### **Scenario**: Company wants to airdrop tokens to 10,000 customers

### **Detailed Journey (High-stakes, Multi-phase)**

#### **Phase 1: Environment Setup** (First-time only, complex)

```
1. Install our CLI ‚Üí How? npm? cargo install? Binary download?
2. Install Solana CLI ‚Üí Which version? How do they know?
3. Generate admin keypair ‚Üí solana-keygen new admin.json
4. Fund admin keypair ‚Üí How much SOL needed? Where do they get it?
5. Learn the workflow ‚Üí Documentation, examples, gotchas
```

#### **Phase 2: CSV Development** (Outside our scope, affects UX)

```
6. Build recipient lists ‚Üí Hard work, data analysis, business logic
7. Validate CSV format ‚Üí Our tooling can help here
8. Test with small datasets ‚Üí Need good testing workflow
```

#### **Phase 3: Campaign Deployment** (High-stakes, bulletproof)

```
9. Compile campaign locally ‚Üí prism-protocol-cli compile-campaign
10. Verify compilation ‚Üí Check amounts, fingerprints, etc.
11. Deploy to our on-chain program ‚Üí Trust required, but verified build
12. Verify deployment succeeded ‚Üí Campaign is live on-chain
```

#### **Phase 4: Claim Site Generation** ("Deploy to Vercel" vision)

```
13. Generate static claim site ‚Üí prism-protocol-cli generate-claim-site
14. Customize templates/branding ‚Üí Edit templates, add logos, etc.
15. Test claim site locally ‚Üí Verify wallet connection, eligibility checks
16. Deploy to hosting ‚Üí vercel deploy, netlify, etc.
```

#### **Phase 5: Campaign Lifecycle Management** (Timeline control)

```
17. Publish "check eligibility" mode ‚Üí Site live, but no claiming yet
18. Campaign activation on date ‚Üí On-chain campaign.is_active = true
19. Monitor claims progress ‚Üí Dashboards, alerts, support
20. Handle edge cases ‚Üí Stuck transactions, user support
```

### **Architectural Principles**

- **Work in Rust as much as possible** - Leverage existing Rust static site generators
- **Easy customization + tiny client SDK** - Minimal JavaScript, maximum flexibility
- **Trust-maximizers compile from source** - Provide clear source compilation path
- **Self-hosting expects tech chops** - Docker deployment, some technical knowledge required
- **Desktop app potential** - For users who want maximum control
- **Full journey documentation** - Including token creation, end-to-end tutorials

### **Critical UX Requirements**

**High Stakes Nature:**

- Real money, real users, public campaigns
- One-shot deployment (hard to fix mistakes)
- Timeline pressure (specific launch dates)
- CSV development already represents significant investment

**Tooling Gaps Identified:**

- Setup automation (environment setup)
- Validation tooling (catch errors early)
- Testing workflow (safe pipeline testing)
- Verification tools (deployment confidence)
- Lifecycle management (phased rollout)
- Documentation/tutorials (full complexity coverage)
- Support/monitoring (error handling)

#### **Step 1: Data Preparation**

```
Campaign Creator: "I have customers.csv with 10,000 wallet addresses"
```

**Questions:**

- How do they know their CSV won't be modified?
- What verification do they get that their exact list was used?

#### **Step 2: Campaign Compilation**

**Hosted Platform Flow:**

```
1. Upload customers.csv to platform
2. Platform compiles campaign ‚Üí generates merkle tree
3. Platform deploys campaign with fingerprint ABC123
4. Campaign Creator receives: "Campaign deployed at fingerprint ABC123"
```

**Trust Gap**: How does Campaign Creator verify that fingerprint ABC123 corresponds exactly to their original customers.csv?

**Self-Hosted Flow:**

```
1. Campaign Creator runs: prism-protocol-cli compile-campaign --csv customers.csv
2. CLI generates campaign.db with fingerprint ABC123
3. Campaign Creator runs: prism-protocol-cli deploy-campaign --db campaign.db
4. Campaign Creator controls entire process
```

**Trust**: Campaign Creator has full control and can verify every step locally.

#### **Step 3: Verification Requirements**

**What Campaign Creator Needs:**

- **Deterministic compilation**: Same CSV always produces same fingerprint
- **Reproducible builds**: Can regenerate campaign locally to verify fingerprint
- **Audit trail**: Can verify deployed campaign matches their original intent
- **Claimant verification**: Can check that only intended recipients are eligible

### **Proposed Verification Mechanism**

```bash
# Campaign Creator can always verify locally
prism-protocol-cli verify-campaign \
  --original-csv customers.csv \
  --deployed-fingerprint ABC123 \
  --rpc-url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Output:
‚úÖ Fingerprint ABC123 matches customers.csv exactly
‚úÖ On-chain merkle roots correspond to provided CSV
‚úÖ No additional claimants detected
‚úÖ All amounts match expected distribution
```

## ü™ô Token Claimant Journey: Eligibility Discovery

### **Scenario**: User hears about airdrop, wants to check and claim

### **Simple User Journey (Should be effortless)**

#### **Phase 1: Discovery & Connection**

```
1. Hear about campaign ‚Üí Social media, discord, email
2. Visit claim site ‚Üí https://company-airdrop.vercel.app
3. Connect wallet ‚Üí Phantom, Solflare, etc. (one click)
4. See eligibility status ‚Üí Instant feedback
```

#### **Phase 2: Pre-claim Period (Eligibility check only)**

```
5. View entitled amounts ‚Üí "You're eligible for 500 TOKENS across 2 cohorts"
6. Understand timeline ‚Üí "Claims go live on March 15th"
7. Prepare for claiming ‚Üí Ensure wallet has SOL for fees
```

#### **Phase 3: Claiming Period (Claims active)**

```
8. Return to site ‚Üí When claims are live
9. Review claim details ‚Üí Final amounts, gas fees
10. Execute claim ‚Üí Sign transaction(s)
11. Confirmation ‚Üí Tokens in wallet, receipt stored
```

### **Critical Claimant Requirements**

**Effortless Experience:**

- No CLI tools, no technical knowledge
- Wallet connection works on mobile
- Clear error messages ("Need 0.01 SOL for fees")
- Works across different wallets/devices

**Trust & Verification:**

- Can verify amounts are correct (merkle proof validation)
- Can see campaign source/deployer
- Can verify transaction success independently

**Edge Cases:**

- Multiple cohort eligibility (batch claiming?)
- Failed transactions (retry mechanism)
- Wallet switching (different device/wallet)

#### **Step 1: Campaign Discovery**

```
Claimant: "I heard about XYZ campaign, am I eligible?"
```

**Information Needed:**

- What campaigns exist?
- Which campaigns am I eligible for?
- How much can I claim from each?

#### **Step 2: Eligibility Verification**

**Hosted Platform Flow:**

```
1. Visit hosted lookup: https://claims.prism.com/campaigns
2. Connect wallet: 7BgBvyjrZX8YKHGoW9Y8929nsq6TsQANzvsGVEpVLUD8
3. See eligible campaigns and amounts
```

**Trust Gap**: How does claimant know the displayed amounts are accurate?

**Self-Hosted Flow:**

```
1. Campaign Creator provides their own lookup URL: https://xyz-company.com/claims
2. Claimant connects wallet
3. See campaigns hosted by that specific company
```

**Trust**: Claimant trusts the campaign creator directly.

#### **Step 3: Amount Verification**

**What Claimant Needs:**

- **On-chain verification**: Displayed amounts match merkle proof math
- **Proof validation**: Can verify merkle proof against on-chain root
- **Source verification**: Can see which entity compiled/deployed campaign

### **Proposed Verification Mechanism**

```typescript
// Frontend always validates proofs client-side
const validateEligibility = async (
  claimant: PublicKey,
  proofs: MerkleProof[]
) => {
  // 1. Fetch on-chain campaign and merkle roots
  const onChainCampaign = await connection.getAccountInfo(campaignAddress);

  // 2. Verify merkle proofs against on-chain roots
  for (const proof of proofs) {
    const isValid = verifyMerkleProof(
      proof.leaf,
      proof.proof,
      onChainCampaign.merkleRoot
    );
    assert(isValid, "Merkle proof validation failed");
  }

  // 3. Verify amounts match proof calculations
  const calculatedAmount = proof.entitlements * proof.amountPerEntitlement;
  assert(calculatedAmount === proof.totalClaimable, "Amount mismatch");

  return true; // All verifications passed
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Frontend Builder Journey: Data Access

### **Scenario**: Team wants to build custom claiming interface

### **Developer Journey (Should be straightforward)**

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup**

```
1. Choose integration approach ‚Üí Use our template vs. build from scratch
2. Install dependencies ‚Üí Our tiny client SDK + Solana wallet adapters
3. Set up development environment ‚Üí Next.js, Vite, whatever they prefer
4. Get sample data ‚Üí Test campaigns for development
```

#### **Phase 2: Development**

```
5. Integrate wallet connection ‚Üí Standard Solana wallet patterns
6. Query eligibility data ‚Üí Our client SDK handles this
7. Build claim UX ‚Üí Custom design with our SDK
8. Test end-to-end ‚Üí Local validator, test campaigns
```

#### **Phase 3: Data & Deployment**

```
9. Get campaign data ‚Üí Static files or API endpoints
10. Configure production ‚Üí Real campaign fingerprints, mainnet
11. Deploy frontend ‚Üí Their hosting choice
12. Monitor & support ‚Üí Handle user issues
```

### **Frontend Builder Options**

#### **Option 1: Use Our Template** (Recommended)

```
Frontend Builder: "I'll start with your template and customize"
```

**Benefits:**

- Working wallet integration out of the box
- Proven claim flow and error handling
- Easy customization through templates/CSS
- Built-in verification and security

**Process:**

```bash
# Generate customized claim site
prism-protocol-cli generate-claim-site \
  --campaign-db my-campaign.db \
  --template modern \
  --branding-kit ./my-branding/ \
  --output ./my-claim-site

# Customize and deploy
cd my-claim-site
npm run build  # or just static files
vercel deploy   # or any hosting
```

#### **Option 2: Build Custom with Our SDK**

```
Frontend Builder: "I'll build from scratch with your SDK"
```

**Benefits:**

- Full control over UI/UX
- Can integrate into existing sites
- Custom business logic
- Any framework (React, Vue, Svelte)

**Process:**

```typescript
// Install our lightweight client SDK
npm install @prism-protocol/client

// Use in any frontend framework
import { PrismClient, verifyEligibility } from '@prism-protocol/client';

const client = new PrismClient({
  campaignData: '/static/campaign-data.json' // Or API endpoint
});

const eligibility = await client.checkEligibility(walletPubkey);
```

#### **Option 3: Self-Host Data Generation**

```
Frontend Builder: "I'll generate my own data serving"

# Generate static lookup files
prism-protocol-cli generate-claimant-lookup \
  --campaigns-dir ./campaigns \
  --output-dir ./static-lookup

# Serve via own infrastructure
nginx -s ./static-lookup/
```

**Benefits:**

- Full control over data
- No external dependencies
- Can verify everything locally

**Costs:**

- Infrastructure management
- Need to stay synced with campaigns

### **SDK Design Principles**

**Tiny Client SDK:**

- No bundler lock-in (works with any build system)
- Tree-shakeable (only import what you need)
- TypeScript-first with great DX
- Wallet-agnostic (works with any Solana wallet)

**Easy Customization:**

- Template system with clear override points
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Component-level customization
- Clear documentation for common modifications

## üîç Auditor/Verifier Journey: Independent Verification

### **Scenario**: Security researcher wants to verify campaign integrity

### **Technical User Journey (CLI-focused)**

#### **Phase 1: Campaign Discovery**

```
1. Learn about campaign ‚Üí Public announcement, social media
2. Get original data ‚Üí CSV files, campaign details from creator
3. Identify on-chain deployment ‚Üí Campaign fingerprint, admin pubkey
4. Set up verification environment ‚Üí Our CLI, Solana CLI
```

#### **Phase 2: Independent Verification**

```
5. Reproduce campaign compilation ‚Üí Same CSV + CLI = same fingerprint?
6. Verify on-chain deployment ‚Üí Fingerprint matches deployed campaign?
7. Check merkle tree integrity ‚Üí All proofs mathematically valid?
8. Validate fund allocation ‚Üí Vaults funded correctly?
```

#### **Phase 3: Public Verification**

```
9. Document findings ‚Üí Report discrepancies or confirm integrity
10. Publish verification ‚Üí Social proof for community
11. Monitor ongoing claims ‚Üí Watch for anomalies
```

### **Auditor Tooling Requirements**

**Deterministic Verification:**

```bash
# Must produce identical results to original deployment
prism-protocol-cli verify-campaign \
  --original-csv community-airdrop.csv \
  --deployed-fingerprint abc123... \
  --rpc-url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Should output:
‚úÖ CSV hash: abc123... (matches public commitment)
‚úÖ Campaign fingerprint: def456... (matches on-chain)
‚úÖ Merkle roots: ghi789... (all cohorts verified)
‚úÖ Vault funding: 1,000,000 tokens (exact match)
‚úÖ No additional claimants detected
```

**Mathematical Verification:**

```bash
# Verify every merkle proof can be reconstructed
prism-protocol-cli audit-merkle-tree \
  --campaign-db community-airdrop.db \
  --sample-size 1000  # Check random sample

# Verify on-chain state matches expectations
prism-protocol-cli audit-on-chain-state \
  --campaign-fingerprint abc123... \
  --admin-pubkey def456...
```

**Public Reporting:**

- Generate verification reports
- Export audit logs and evidence
- Create reproducible verification instructions
- Document any discrepancies found

### **Trust Model for Auditors**

**What Auditors Verify:**

- Original CSV data integrity (if publicly committed)
- Deterministic compilation (same inputs = same outputs)
- On-chain deployment correctness (campaign matches CSV)
- Mathematical soundness (merkle trees, allocations)
- No injection attacks (extra claimants, inflated amounts)

**What Auditors Provide:**

- Independent verification of campaign integrity
- Public trust signals for the community
- Detection of systemic issues or attacks
- Competitive verification (multiple auditors can check same campaign)

## üîê Trust Model Summary

### **Hosted Platform Trust Requirements**

1. **Campaign Creators** must be able to verify:

   - Their exact CSV was used (no injected claimants)
   - Deployed fingerprint matches their original data
   - On-chain state corresponds to their intent

2. **Claimants** must be able to verify:

   - Displayed amounts match on-chain merkle proofs
   - Merkle proofs are mathematically valid
   - Campaign was deployed by legitimate entity

3. **Frontend Builders** must be able to verify:
   - Served data matches on-chain state
   - Service availability and reliability
   - Fallback to self-hosting if needed

### **Self-Hosted Trust Model**

1. **Campaign Creators**: Full control, can verify every step locally
2. **Claimants**: Same cryptographic verification requirements
3. **Frontend Builders**: Full control over data serving and verification

## üìã Next Steps

**Key Questions to Resolve:**

1. What verification tooling do we need to build?
2. How do we make local verification simple for non-technical users?
3. What's the simplest way to enable self-hosting?
4. How do we handle campaign discovery across multiple hosts?

**Priority Order:**

1. Build robust local verification tools
2. Design hosted platform with verification-first approach
3. Enable simple self-hosting workflows
4. Create frontend integration patterns

## üèóÔ∏è Self-Hosted Template Architecture (VERY SPECULATIVE, MODEL MIGHT BE WRONG, KEEPING AS FOOD FOR THOUGHT)

### **Template Structure (Next.js/React Example)**

```typescript
// Next.js/React template that loads from IPFS
export default function ClaimSite() {
  const campaignIPFS = process.env.CAMPAIGN_IPFS;

  // Load verified campaign data
  const { data: campaignData } = useSWR(campaignIPFS, async (hash) => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${hash}`);
    const data = await response.json();

    // Verify hash matches content (cryptographic guarantee)
    const actualHash = await calculateIPFSHash(data);
    if (actualHash !== hash) {
      throw new Error("IPFS content verification failed");
    }

    return data;
  });

  return <ClaimInterface campaignData={campaignData} />;
}
```

### **Configuration-Based Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Fork template repository
git clone https://github.com/prism-protocol/claim-site-template
cd claim-site-template

# 2. Configure with your IPFS hashes
echo 'CAMPAIGN_IPFS="QmCampaignABC123..."' > .env

# 3. Customize branding (optional)
cp ./branding-kit/* ./public/branding/

# 4. Deploy anywhere
npm run build
vercel deploy  # or netlify, github pages, etc.
```

## ü§î Technical UX Considerations

### **IPFS Integration Challenges**

- **Custom domains**: Require IPFS gateway or DNS setup
- **Performance**: Can be slower than dedicated CDN
- **User familiarity**: ipfs.io URLs less familiar than custom domains
- **Gateway reliability**: Public gateways can be inconsistent

### **Hybrid Approach: IPFS + Static Sites**

**Best of both worlds:**

- **IPFS**: Immutable, content-addressed, decentralized data integrity
- **Static Sites**: Fast, familiar, normal website UX for end users
- **Auditability**: Anyone can verify sites serve authentic IPFS content

### **Key UX Questions to Explore**

- How fast is IPFS content loading for end users?
- Which IPFS gateways are most reliable?
- How do we handle IPFS pinning for persistence?
- Can we make IPFS URLs feel like normal websites?
- Are ipfs.io URLs too scary for normal users?
- How do we handle custom domains over IPFS?
- What happens if IPFS gateways are slow/down?
- Can we make wallet connection work smoothly with IPFS sites?
